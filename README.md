# Collinearity
Determine if there are three points that are collinear. There are 5 different ways that I implemented to find collinearity.
This project was created to test the fastest way of determining if three points are collinear for a random uniform distributioin.

The different methods are:
1. Brute Force method
2. Less Brute Force method (avoid duplicates)
3. Calculating all the slopes/intercepts and sorting
4. Calculating slopes/intercepts and storing in a Binary Tree
5. Calculating slopes/intercepts and storing in a HashSet
6. Calcualting all slopes/intercepts for a given point and then sorting, and repeating this for every point
